			<h3>Functional Minimalism</h3>
			<p>Function minimalism refers to reducing the range of possible actions a user is capable to complete on a interface. By doing
            so it provides user a more "straigh forward" experience. By avoiding unneccesary features and/ or functions you dont limit the user 
            experience but the amount of possible errors.</p>

              <h3>Important UI Principles</h3>
              <p>In my opinion user control, low cognitive load, and problem-solving engineeringth are the three most important UI Design principles. 
                  User control is very important to assure a user has a good experience, this principle focuses on giving the user a sense 
                  of control during their experience. Low cognitive load principle refers to not overwhelming 
                  the user with information by simplifying interface and information provided. Problem solving engineering refers to reducing
                   the possible errors caused by user by thinking of every
                    possible scenario the user may encounter or do. </p>
